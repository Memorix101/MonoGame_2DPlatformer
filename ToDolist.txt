- Player will be stopped by screen bounds on the left side -> can only walk to right [OK] <- I made it work, but then I decided to make it "modern"
- Coin collision detection [OK]
- Jump logic (double jump and gounded bool for not "spam jummping") [OK]
- Scene manager to easily change the level and display (Menu to Level, Introscreen etc.) [OK]
- "Experimental" try to make a Level Editor (Windows Forms or MonoGame, preferred to try in MonoGame itself)
- Write GameState Component "just basic enum to track that" <- What ever I've meant here, next time I have to declaire it more detailed, 'cause I can't remember it :X
- Mario like enemies, can be killed by jumping on their head/top side and have that lemming walk behaivior [OK]
- World Map Idea: Make enum (like menu) and Vector Lerp to position next position (level mark)
- Parallax scrolling: make camera follow player on x axis when hitting the screen bounds range and make mountain background fixed and clouds should move [OK]
